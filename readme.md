## My website

Hello. My name is Jesse and this is my [website](http://jespajo.com/).

#### How it works

The site is served by a Node app deployed on Heroku.

A unique Express template engine ([`/modules/html.js`](https://github.com/jespajo/site/blob/master/modules/html.js)) replaces html nodes containing processing instructions (such as `<?directory?>`) with blocks of html after running server-side code associated with the instruction.

#### To do

See [issues](https://github.com/jespajo/site/issues).
