## My website

Hello. My name is Jesse Paris-Jourdan and this is [my website](http://jespajo.com/)!

My approach is simple and DIY. The site is served by a Node.js app. I didn't use any frameworks or libraries. It's all vanilla js.

If I save files in `public/pages/d/`, they automatically get scraped for info and linked [here](http://jespajo.com/).

A unique Express.js template engine replaces specified self-closing tags such as `<directory />` with blocks of html code.


### To do

- Simple md to html converter. This would allow me to save markdown files in `d/` and have them rendered on a simple but nice-looking html page which then appears in the directory

- Add Google Analytics (lightest option)

- Add easter egg to `d` that shows the `display:none`'d table rows in the directory
