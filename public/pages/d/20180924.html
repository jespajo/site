  <title>principles for javascript</title>

  <p>
    principles for decent javascript written by someone who is very much still learning:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      javascript is a beautiful language
    </li>
    <li>
      code should be as concise as possible BUT
    </li>
    <li>
      code should also be readable by humans. including documentation where necessary. the dream is self-documenting code: no need for documentation because the code is a natural expression of human ideas
    </li>
    <li>
      use vanilla js rather than libraries where possible, even if it means code is "longer" (actually probably not true if you count the library the user has to load; also libraries/frameworks change but the underlying language generally stays the same and you have to master that)
    </li>
    <li>
      functional programming
    </li>
    <li>
      move slow and fix things
    </li>
  </ul>
</body>
