        It&rsquo;s fair to say I feel like an utter failure at the moment.

But some money should be coming in tomorrow or the next day from a few sources. One of them because I got a refund on an UberEATS order of McDonald&rsquo;s after I received the order and made a complaint that it never arrived. No questions asked: they refunded me and added a small credit (five dollars) on my account. <span class="blackout"> &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; &#9632;</span>
