Hello! If you're wondering how I made this:
- I used a JavaScript library called Matter.js to render the physics simulation (http://brm.io/matter-js/).
- A plugin for that library (https://github.com/dxu/matter-collision-events) helped with figuring out whether the pastry puff circles were on the plate (i.e. "colliding" with a rectangle I defined).
- The typing effect I wrote myself in JavaScript.

    <p><span class="firstLetter">I</span><p>n 1986, my dad quit his job at a restaurant in Sydney, took a taxi to the airport and tried to catch a flight to New Zealand. They didn&rsquo;t let him. He&rsquo;d been in Australia for six months&mdash;longer than his visa allowed&mdash;so he could board a plane only if it flew him home to France.</p>
    <p>He wasn&rsquo;t ready to go back. He&rsquo;d been enjoying a prolonged world tour, partly motivated by the desire to put off for as long as possible a mandatory year in the French army.</p>
    <p>He went back to the restaurant and asked if he could keep his job. The once and future kitchen hand.</p>
    <p>A few months later, working there, he met my mum, a 21-year-old Australian woman, three years younger than him. She wasn&rsquo;t doing great at the time. She had little contact with a young son (my older brother) and not much of a firmer grasp on reality itself&mdash;she&rsquo;d get clean in a few years, but for most of the &lsquo;80s was addicted to speed, which frequently gave her psychosis. Once, accusing Dad of being in love with a mutual friend, she brandished a kitchen knife. Gently, stupidly, he tried to take it from her. She pulled down, slicing open his hand.</p>
    <p>They got married six months after they met and were together 16 years. They&rsquo;re good friends today.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t know why he stayed,&rdquo; Mum says when she tells me stories from the early days.</p>
    <p>Love, I think. And citizenship. (But mostly love.)</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Your father was an angel,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;He saved me.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>For their wedding, Dad&rsquo;s boss at the restaurant made a croquembouche. I&rsquo;ve seen the disposable-camera photos of Mum dismantling it. She wore a gauzy purple dress. She looked pretty. But the dessert could have stayed intact&mdash;nobody was hungry. Speed kills your appetite, and everyone was speeding.</p>
    <p>When I tell these stories to my boyfriend, I say dramatically, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I come from!&rdquo; (I think to myself, even more dramatically, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll always go back to.&rdquo;)</p>
    <p>Now I&rsquo;m addicted to speed too&emdash;but it&rsquo;s okay because it&rsquo;s prescription: little orange circle Adderall pills. I wonder how they stack up.</p>
