        <span class="firstLetter">I</span><p>n 1986, my dad quit his job as a kitchen hand at a restaurant called Au Chabrol in Sydney, took a taxi to Sydney airport and tried to board a plane to New Zealand. The airport staff didn&rsquo;t let him fly. He had already stayed in Australia longer than his visa allowed, they told him, so he could only get on a plane if it took him home to France. He had been in Australia for six months, having previously spent a year travelling through Europe and North Africa. He intended to keep travelling for some time before going home&mdash;a world tour inspired by a wish to avoid France&rsquo;s compulsory military service. Now, unsure what to do, he returned to Au Chabrol and asked for his job back. They gave it to him. The once and future kitchen hand.</p>

        A few months later, he met my mum while working at that restaurant. Mum was a pretty 21-year-old Australian, three years younger than Dad. She had a young child she didn&rsquo;t get to see much and a loose hold on reality: she would get clean in the following years, but was, at the time, deep in the grip of a speed addiction, regularly experiencing psychosis.

        They got married six months after they met. Dad&rsquo;s boss made a croquembouche for the wedding. There are photos of mum standing over it in a white blouse and gauzy purple dress. The dessert remained intact, Mum later told me&mdash;nobody wanted to eat it because they were all speeding out of their minds.

      There are ten pastry puffs and one plate on this page. Text will appear as you arrange the puffs into a croquembouche on the plate.
