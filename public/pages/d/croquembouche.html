          n 1986, my dad quit his job as a kitchen-hand at a restaurant called Au Chabrol in Sydney, went to Sydney airport and tried to board a plane to New Zealand. The airport staff didn&rsquo;t let him fly. He had already stayed longer than his Australian visa allowed, so he could only get on a plane if it took him home to France. He had been in Australia for six months, having previously spent a year travelling through Europe and North Africa. He intended to keep travelling for some time before going home&mdash;a world tour inspired by a desire to skip compulsory military conscription. Now, unsure what to do, he returned to Au Chabrol in Sydney and asked for his job back. They gave it to him. The once and future kitchen-hand.

        A few months later, he met my mum while working at that restaurant. Mum was a pretty 21-year-old Australian with a three-year-old child she didn&rsquo;t get to see much and a crazed look in her eyes&mdash;deep in the grip of speed psychosis at this time, she would get clean in the following years. They got married six months after they met.

        Dad&rsquo;s boss made this huge lovely croquembouche for the wedding. There are photos of mum standing over it in a white blouse and gauzy purple dress. But it remained intact, Mum later told me&mdash;nobody wanted to eat it because they were all speeding out of their minds.

      There are ten pastry puffs and one plate on this page. Text will appear as you arrange the puffs into a croquembouche on the plate.
