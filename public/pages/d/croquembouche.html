        <span class="firstLetter">I</span><p>n 1986, my dad quit his job at a restaurant in Sydney, took a taxi to the airport and tried to board a plane to New Zealand. They didn&rsquo;t let him fly. He&rsquo;d stayed in Australia longer than his visa allowed, they said, and could only get on a plane that took him home to France. He didn&rsquo;t want to go home&mdash;he was enjoying a would tour, partly inspired by a desire to avoid his home country&rsquo;s mandatory military service. Unsure what to do, he asked for his job back at the restaurant. The once and future kitchen hand.</p>
      </p>
      <p> 
        A few months later, working there, he met my mum. She was a 21-year-old Australian&mdash;three years younger than Dad&mdash;with a loose hold both on a young son and on reality: she would get clean later, but at the time was addicted to speed, ocassionally to the point of psychosis. Once, when Dad tried to take a knife from her, she pulled down, slicing open his hand.
      </p>
      <p>  
        They got married six months after they met, were together 16 years and are still good friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;God knows why he stayed with me,&rdquo; Mum says when she tells me these stories. I only hear them from her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dad&rsquo;s boss made a croquembouche for their wedding. There are photos of Mum standing over it, looking pretty in a gauzy purple dress. The dessert remained intact. Nobody wanted to eat because they were all speeding.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I tell these stories, to a friend, I say dramatically, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I come from.&rdquo;

      There are ten pastry puffs and one plate on this page. Text will appear as you arrange the puffs into a croquembouche on the plate.
