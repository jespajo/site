Hello! If you're wondering how I made this:
- I used a JavaScript library called Matter.js to render the physics simulation (http://brm.io/matter-js/).
- A plugin to that library (https://github.com/dxu/matter-collision-events) helped with figuring out whether the pastry puff circles were on the plate (i.e. "colliding" with a square I defined).
- The typing effect I wrote myself in JavaScript.

        <span class="firstLetter">I</span><p>n 1986, my dad quit his job at a restaurant in Sydney, taxied to the airport and tried to catch a flight to New Zealand. They didn&rsquo;t let him. He&rsquo;d been in Australia for six months&mdash;longer than his visa allowed, they said&mdash;so he could only board a plane if it flew him home to France. He wasn&rsquo;t ready to go home. He&rsquo;d been enjoying a world tour, partly driven by a desire to put off for as long as possible his mandatory year in the French army. So he went back to the restaurant and asked if he could keep his job. The once and future kitchen hand.</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        A few months later, working there, he met my mum. She was a 21-year-old Australian, three years younger than him, who had little contact with her young son and not much of a firmer grasp on reality&mdash;she&rsquo;d get clean in a few years, but at the time was addicted to speed, which made her psychotic. Once, accusing Dad of being in love with a friend, she brandished a kitchen knife. He gently tried to take it from her, and she pulled down, slicing open his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        They got married six months after they met, were together 16 years and are still good friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t know why he stayed,&rdquo; Mum says when she tells me stories from the early days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love, I think. And citizenship.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your father was an angel,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;He saved me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        For their wedding, Dad&rsquo;s boss made a croquembouche. I&rsquo;ve seen the disposable-camera photos of Mum dismantling it, looking pretty in a gauzy purple dress. But the dessert could have stayed intact&mdash;nobody was hungry. Everyone was speeding.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I tell these stories to a friend, I say dramatically, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I come from!&rdquo; And I say to myself, even more dramatically, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll always go back to.&rdquo;

      There are ten pastry puffs and one plate on this page. Text will appear as you arrange the puffs into a croquembouche on the plate.
